Be sure to add fences at the top of astro components for dynamic server logic

```astro

// I'm inside the fences
const example = "example string"

<p>Templates String</p>
```

- Optimize images using Astro's built-in tools
- Use client directives sparingly
- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content without reactive state
- Use React components (.tsx) only when reactive state or client-side interactivity is required
- Leverage Astro v5 features and optimizations for best performance

Use framework specific components for like images and other optimizations that astro has out of the box check the official documentation regularly.
