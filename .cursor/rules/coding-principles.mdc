## Code Style Principles

- Write small lean code modifications and do not be verbose or add things outside of the scope that is requested
- Write self-documenting code following senior engineering practices
- Maintain strict TypeScript usage throughout
- Reference `globals.css` for project-wide styling and design tokens
- Utilize Strapi types from `@types/strapi.ts` for backend data structures
- Follow the established commit convention (referenced in README.md, lines 80-89)

  **Code Quality**

  - Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
  - Use pre-commit hooks for code quality
  - Follow the established commit convention
