        Artist and son of a Texas legend, Frank X. Tolbert 2, continued the
        legacy of his father, both in the artistic realm and the unique world of
        Texas chili. His works have been showcased in renowned museums such as
        the Modern of Fort Worth and Dallas Museum of Art (DMA). Tolbert 2's
        work featured colorful, stylized renderings of birds, his unique
        artistic eye captured in pieces such as

        >
          "Bluejay with Peanut"
        </a> (2017).
      </p>

      <p>
        Frank X. Tolbert 2 embraced his Texas roots, reflected both in his
        popularity as an artist and his personal connection to the state's
        cultural events, most notably the Terlingua Chili Cookoff. This event
        was the brainchild of his father,

          class="font-medium text-primary underline underline-offset-4"
        >
          Frank X. Tolbert
        </a>, who sought to immortalize the traditional Texas chili recipe and
        engage the community in a light-hearted culinary competition. The
        Cookoff, which began in 1967 in Terlingua, Texas, formed an integral
        part of Tolbert 2's upbringing and offered a rich, cultural context that
        influenced his later works.
      </p>

      <p>
        On July 13, at his home in Houston, Tolbert passed away at the age of
        77. Friends remember him as a man blessed with a legendary wit and
        gentlemanly manners, a person who found humor in any situation. Despite
        hailing from a legendary Texas family, Tolbert managed to carve out his
        own identity, distinguishing himself through his distinctive artistic
        style.
      </p>

      <p>
        Former art critic for the Houston Post, Susan Chadwick, is among the
        many mourning the loss of Tolbert 2, describing his work as "witty and
        imaginative". His pieces often delved into themes of mortality, self,
        birds, nature, and of course, his Texas roots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tolbert 2, along with his wife and fellow artist, Ann Stautberg, shared
        decades of travel, crisscrossing the globe, always carrying their love
        for their home state with them. In recent years, he turned his focus to
        the

          Texas Bird Project
        </a>, a series of colorful, stylized renderings of native Texas birds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite being born in Washington, D.C., the younger Tolbert spent
        considerable time exploring Texas with his legendary father. He followed
        in his father's footsteps, contributing to the legacy of the Terlingua
        Chili Cookoff and continuing the tradition of celebrating the unique
        flavors of Texas.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Tolbert family's commitment to Texas extends beyond chili. Kathleen
        Tolbert Ryan, Frank 2's younger sister, continues to operate Tolbert's
        Chili Parlor, initially founded by their father in downtown Dallas.

        Frank 2, an alumnus of Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas and Texas
        Tech University where he studied art, is survived by his wife and
        sister. The Tolbert family has asked for donations in Frank 2's memory
        to be made to

        who gave so much to the art world of Texas.
